# LinearFS Architecture

LinearFS exposes Linear.app as a FUSE filesystem: issues, projects, initiatives,
and team metadata appear as a navigable directory tree of editable markdown files.
Editing a file's YAML frontmatter or body updates Linear; the filesystem is the UI,
the Linear API is the source of truth, and SQLite is a persistent cache in between.

This document maps the subsystems and, more importantly, **how they interact**.
For per-package internals see the source; this is the orientation map.

Reading the graph: solid arrows on the left half are the **read path** (user →
FUSE → fs → repo → SQLite, never the Linear API); the right half is **ingest**
(worker → api.Client → Linear, reconciled into SQLite) and the **write path**
(fs → api.Client → Linear, then backfilled into — or, for deletes, forgotten
from — SQLite and punched through the kernel caches via `kernelNotify`). Dotted
arrows are background/lazy/cross-cutting; note the one deliberate write-path →
worker edge (stale-catalog refresh) and that embedded-file bytes come from the
CDN, not SQLite.

## The pipeline

The system is a one-directional read pipeline with a side-channel for writes:

```
                 reads (background, every ~2 min)
  Linear API ──> api.Client ──> Sync Worker ──> SQLite ──> Repository ──> LinearFS ──> FUSE ──> user
   (truth)                       (ingest)       (cache)     (read API)    (nodes)    (kernel)

                 writes (synchronous, on save / rm)
  user ──> FUSE ──> LinearFS commit tails ──> api.Client ──> Linear API
                          │                                      │
                          └── upsert / forget ──> SQLite <───────┘ (read-your-writes refetch)
```

Two rules govern the whole design:

1. **Reads never touch the Linear API.** Every metadata read is served from
   SQLite via the Repository, with no blocking cold-cache fetch: a read returns
   whatever SQLite holds and, when a sub-resource looks stale, kicks a
   **non-blocking** background refresh (stale-while-revalidate). The Sync Worker
   keeps SQLite fresh. Two deliberate exceptions block on the network: embedded
   attachment bytes (`*.png`, `*.pdf`) fall through memory → disk → a lazy CDN
   GET (`embeddedFileCache`), and a handful of interactive-tier synchronous
   reads (a few write-flow re-checks, e.g. the attachment-listing live
   re-check and the project read-your-writes re-fetch) — see `WithInteractive`
   under the rate budget.
2. **Writes go straight to the API, then backfill the cache.** The `api.Client`
   only talks to Linear — it never writes SQLite. The FUSE write handlers
   (`Flush`, `Mkdir`, `_create`, `rm`/`rmdir`) are responsible for upserting the
   result into — or, after a delete, forgetting the row from — SQLite and
   invalidating kernel caches so the next read sees fresh data.

This decoupling is deliberate: ingest (Sync Worker → SQLite) and serve
(SQLite → Repository → FUSE) are separate concerns, joined only by the database.
The upsert-then-prune tail lives in `internal/reconcile`, shared by the Sync
Worker and the Repository's SWR refreshes.

## Subsystems

### `internal/api` — Linear GraphQL client (the only Linear GraphQL caller)

The lowest layer and the only one that speaks the Linear GraphQL API. (Two other
components make HTTP calls, both to Linear's uploads CDN rather than the API:
`internal/fs`'s `embeddedFileCache` GETs embedded-file bytes on read, and
`internal/reconcile`'s `Extractor` HEADs embedded-file URLs for their sizes
during sync.) Its only internal dependency is the small `internal/telemetry`
instrument-constructor helpers. Exposes 26 query methods (`GetTeamIssuesPage`,
`GetTeamMetadata`, `GetInitiativesProbe`, `GetIssueDetailsBatch`, …) backed by
31 named GraphQL operations — combined fetches like `GetTeamMetadata` issue
several (metadata query + drain-page twins) — and ~30 mutation methods
(`UpdateIssue`, `CreateComment`, `CreateLabel`, …). Types in `types.go` mirror
Linear's schema; queries in `queries.go` are built from 17 shared GraphQL
fragments (`IssueFields`, `IssueFieldsLite`, `CommentFields`, …) concatenated as
Go string constants. Two fragment rules prevent silent drift:

- A combined query and its **drain-page twin** must project through the same
  fragment, or nodes past page one silently carry zero values.
- Every **mutation response** must project through the entity's fragment, not an
  inlined field list (the attachment mutations once drifted and dropped fields).

**Read-fetch envelope** (`fetch.go`, `paginate.go`): single-entity and
single-list reads decode through `fetchOne` / `fetchNodes` / `fetchConn` over a
shared `walkPath`. A null terminal is an **error** (not a silent zero value),
and `fetchNodes` trips loudly if a connection reports `hasNextPage` — paginated
reads must drain via `fetchAll`, which guards against stalled/repeating cursors
and caps runaway pagination. Three paths bypass the fronts: the combined
metadata queries decode their first page into hand-written structs before
draining remainders, the aliased `GetIssueDetailsBatch` decodes a raw alias map,
and mutations use their own envelope.

Operational guards:

- **Rate budget** (`ratebudget.go`): dual-axis — request count *and* GraphQL
  complexity points — anchored to the server's
  `X-RateLimit-{Requests,Complexity}-{Limit,Remaining,Reset}` response headers
  (plus the per-query `X-Complexity` cost header) rather than hardcoded limits.
  The axes don't gate at all until the first response's headers seed them; only
  the 16-token micro-burst pacing limiter is pre-seeded (at a 2,500 req/hr
  rate) and re-sized at first contact. Operations are classed into priority
  tiers, each with a reserve fraction of budget it may not eat into: writes 0%
  (they always win), interactive 2%, up to bulk detail fetches at 40%.
  `api.WithInteractive(ctx)` promotes a user-blocking synchronous call to the
  interactive tier — the fs render closures thread the FUSE handler ctx for
  exactly this — with a documented never-store rule: a promoted ctx is minted at
  the moment of the call, never kept on a struct or handed to a goroutine.
- **Circuit breaker** (`client.go`): after 5 consecutive network errors, opens
  for 30s to stop wasting budget during an outage.
- **Metrics** (`metrics.go`): OTEL counters/histograms for per-op requests,
  latency, complexity, and budget decisions (admit/defer/wait/ratelimited).
- **Request log** (`requestlog.go`): optional JSONL trace of every completed
  request (op, vars, duration, outcome, complexity) to
  `~/.config/linearfs/requests.jsonl`, for offline diagnosis.
- **Error predicates** (`errors.go`): `IsRateLimited`, `IsNotFound`,
  `IsFieldTooLong` — the vocabulary the fs layer's error classifier maps to
  errnos.

**Consumed by:** Sync Worker (reads), Repository (SWR refreshes and its
reconcile pass), LinearFS (mutations plus the interactive-tier synchronous
reads), reconcile (entity types and page-size constants). Its types flow
everywhere.

### `internal/sync` — background ingest worker

The ingest side of the pipeline. `Worker` (`worker.go`) runs a goroutine on a
~2-minute ticker, started with the mount-lifetime context and stopped on
unmount. Before the first cycle it fires a **cold-start budget probe** — one
cheap `GetViewer` so real server headers seed both budget axes strictly before
expensive sync work; a rate-limited probe puts the worker to sleep until the
server-reported reset. Cycles come in two sizes:

- **Lean cycle** (the steady state): a cheap initiatives *probe*, per-team
  project probes, and per-team incremental issue sync. Skips the expensive
  workspace and team-metadata drains — this "sync-cycle diet" cut steady-state
  complexity spend by roughly an order of magnitude.
- **Full cycle** (every ~10 minutes): additionally re-syncs the workspace
  (users, initiatives with their project links, the project-label catalog) and
  full team metadata (states, labels, cycles, projects with milestones,
  members).

**Probes never license a prune**, so metadata deletions and link changes are
bounded by the full-cycle interval by design. That bound is load-bearing for
one live-verified Linear quirk: linking/unlinking a project↔initiative bumps
*neither* entity's `updatedAt`, so link changes are structurally invisible to
the newest-first probes — the full-cycle workspace drain is the *only* thing
keeping links fresh, and cannot be "optimized away".

Scheduling is persisted in the **`sync_schedule`** key/value table: the
full-cycle cadence stamp, per-team probe watermarks, and the issue-ID-reconcile
stamp — all stamp-on-completion (a budget-skipped or failed pass doesn't
stamp) and restart-safe (a restart mid-window starts lean; no full-cycle
storm).

Each cycle, in order: drain the `pending_detail_sync` queue → workspace or
probe → teams list → per-team (metadata or probe, then issues) → the issue-ID
reconcile sweep when due (hourly, all-or-nothing per team, and mutually
exclusive with the repo's reactive reconcile via a CAS). Teams are synced in an
order **rotated by a per-cycle counter**, so mid-cycle budget deferrals rotate
across teams instead of permanently starving the last one — worst-case
staleness is bounded at `len(teams)` cycles.

- **Incremental strategy:** issues are fetched ordered by `updatedAt DESC` and
  pagination stops at the first page whose issues are all older than the
  `sync_meta.last_issue_updated_at` cursor.
- **Detail batching:** comments/docs/attachments/relations are fetched 10 issues
  at a time (`GetIssueDetailsBatch`); 15 exceeded Linear's 10k per-query
  complexity cap.
- **Rate-limit aware:** at 80% hourly budget the whole cycle is skipped; at 70%
  (or after any rate-limit response) detail fetches are deferred into the
  `pending_detail_sync` table and drained in later cycles. `syncDetails` returns
  a `detailOutcome` ledger (synced / deferred / gated) and stamps
  `detail_synced_at` only for issues whose details persisted cleanly.
- **Catch-up mode:** when a single team's incremental sync changes >50 issues,
  it relaxes the Repository's staleness threshold (5 min → 30 min) for the
  remainder of that team's sync, so on-demand refreshes don't duplicate work the
  worker is already doing.
- **Clock seam:** the worker's scheduling and backoff — cycle cadence, interval
  checks, rate-limit expiry, probe waits — go through injected `now` /
  `newTimer` / `newTicker` fields (`clock.go`); no bare `time.Now`/`time.Sleep`
  in the worker, so tests never sleep. (Persisted row timestamps use `db.Now()`,
  outside the seam — see `internal/db`.)

**Reads from** `api.Client`; **writes to** `db.Store` directly
(`store.Queries().Upsert*`) with `reconcile.Collection` as the prune-safe tail.
It does not go through the Repository for writes, and it performs **zero kernel
invalidation** — remote-change visibility is timeout-bounded (see cross-cutting
concerns). It also serves the write path's stale-catalog refreshes
(`RefreshTeamCatalogs` / `RefreshWorkspaceCatalogs` — see the fs write flow).

### `internal/reconcile` — the shared upsert-then-prune tail

A small package owning the one algorithm both ingest paths share:
`Collection(spec)` upserts every fetched item and prunes local rows **only if
every upsert succeeded** (the "clean" guard) — a failed upsert must never
license deleting rows the fetch simply didn't cover. Callers decide whether
prune is licensed at all (nil `Prune` for capped/partial fetches).

- `PersistIssueDetails` applies it to the five per-issue detail collections
  (comments, docs, attachments, relations, inverse relations).
- `Extractor` parses Linear-CDN URLs out of markdown bodies and upserts
  embedded-file rows (the I/O tail of a pure, unit-tested parser).

**Called by:** the Sync Worker (workspace/metadata/details) and the
Repository's SWR refreshes (issue details; project/initiative docs, updates,
links). The fs write tails do **not** go through it — they upsert single
entities directly, and the SWR refresh reconciles behind them.

### `internal/db` — SQLite persistence (sqlc)

The cache and single source of truth for the running process. `schema.sql`
defines 26 tables; queries in `queries.sql` are compiled to type-safe Go by
**sqlc**. `convert.go` holds the bidirectional converters between `api.*` types
and DB rows.

Design conventions:
- **Hybrid storage:** queryable fields are extracted into indexed columns
  (`team_id`, `state_id`, `updated_at`, …) while the full API response is kept in
  a `data JSON` column. Avoids joins (names stored alongside IDs) and keeps the
  schema stable as Linear's API grows.
- **`synced_at` everywhere** for staleness detection; issues additionally carry
  `detail_synced_at`, stamped only when a detail batch persisted cleanly.
- **Hydrate-then-overlay:** for entities with extracted columns (states,
  labels, users, cycles, milestones, …), reverse converters unmarshal the
  `data` blob first, then overlay the columns — so no field is silently
  dropped, and a corrupt blob degrades to column-backed values instead of
  poisoning a listing. Entities whose blob is the whole row (issues, projects,
  comments, …) pure-unmarshal and propagate a parse error instead.
- **Concurrency posture:** the Sync Worker and the FUSE write handlers write
  the same file concurrently. Safety rests on connection pragmas carried in the
  **DSN** — WAL journal mode, `busy_timeout(5000)`, foreign keys — so every
  pooled connection gets them (a `db.Exec("PRAGMA …")` configures only one
  pooled connection; that gap once caused deletes racing the worker to fail
  instantly and leave phantom rows).
- **No transaction wrapper:** multi-table writes are *not* transactional.
  Durability is `busy_timeout` plus single-statement upserts, with the
  reconcile clean-guard providing prune safety; a `Store.WithTx` helper was
  deleted after accruing zero production callers.
- **Time-format gotcha (read side):** the driver uses `_time_format=sqlite`, so
  timestamps come back space-separated, not RFC3339 `T`, and
  `time.Parse(time.RFC3339, …)` fails silently. Always use `ParseSQLiteTime` /
  `ParseSQLiteTimeAny` (`timeparse.go`).
- **Time-stamping invariant (write side):** SQLite orders timestamp TEXT
  lexicographically, and the driver binds a `time.Time` with its zone offset —
  a local-zone stamp misorders against UTC cutoff strings. Every `synced_at`
  write is supposed to go through `db.Now()` (UTC); reconcile's
  cutoff-before-fetch prune pattern depends on it (a local `time.Now()` seed
  once pruned fresh rows).
- **Migrations:** `migrateSchema` applies targeted, idempotent `ALTER TABLE`
  migrations (probe via `PRAGMA table_info`, add if missing); the blunt fallback
  — drop and recreate from the embedded schema on "no such column/table" — still
  exists because the DB is a disposable cache.

**Consumed by:** Sync Worker and reconcile (writes), Repository (reads),
LinearFS handlers (direct upserts/forgets after mutations).

### `internal/repo` — the read layer

The seam between storage and the filesystem: the concrete **`SQLiteRepository`**
(~48 exported methods across issues, comments, docs, labels, projects,
milestones, initiatives, relations, attachments, and the "my" views). A
`Repository` interface with an in-memory mock existed for the project's whole
life without a second consumer and was deliberately deleted — the header comment
in `sqlite.go` says to re-extract it mechanically if a real second adapter ever
appears.

- **`queryOne[R, T]`** (`queryone.go`) canonicalizes single-row getters:
  not-found → `(nil, nil)`, fetch errors labeled with the op, convert errors
  propagated.
- **Stale-while-revalidate** (`swr.go`): `maybeRefreshSWR` is the single owner
  of refresh policy — every sub-resource surface routes through it with an
  `swrSpec` (staleness rule, refresh func, orphan classification). Refreshes are
  non-blocking, bounded by a 10-slot semaphore and a 30s timeout, and persist
  through the `reconcile` tails. Staleness is either TTL-based (5 min; 30 min
  in catch-up mode) or event-driven (`detail_synced_at` older than the entity's
  `updatedAt`).
- **Orphan handling:** a refresh that hits Linear's "Entity not found"
  cascade-deletes the local rows (issue → its comments/docs/attachments/
  relations/history; likewise projects and initiatives) and schedules a
  reconciliation pass (rate-limited to every ~6h) that diffs local IDs against
  the authoritative API sets. The worker's hourly scheduled issue-ID sweep is
  the proactive twin, CAS-excluded from running concurrently with it.

**Reads from** `db.Store`; uses `api.Client` only in the background — SWR
refreshes and the orphan-triggered reconcile pass — a read call itself never
blocks on the network. **Consumed by:** LinearFS for every read.

### `internal/marshal` — markdown ↔ Linear translation

The format boundary. Converts `api.*` objects to markdown (YAML frontmatter +
body) for display, and parses edited markdown back into partial updates —
changed-field maps for issues/documents/labels, a typed diff input for
milestones, and extraction-only structs for projects/initiatives
(`ProjectEdit`/`InitiativeEdit` — the fs edit modules own that diffing).
Parsing is `yaml.v3` end to end (the hand-rolled frontmatter scanner is gone),
and malformed input — e.g. unclosed frontmatter — is rejected loudly rather
than silently treated as body text.

- Symmetric pairs: `IssueToMarkdown` ↔ `MarkdownToIssueUpdate`, plus document,
  milestone, label, project, and initiative variants; history is render-only
  (`history.md` is read-only). `Render` builds frontmatter documents for the
  generated catalog files too.
- **Partial updates:** `MarkdownToIssueUpdate` diffs against the original and
  returns only changed fields.
- **Field clearing:** a deleted frontmatter line becomes an explicit `nil`/`[]`
  in the update map (e.g. removing `assignee:` clears the assignee).
- **Placeholder round-trip** (`placeholder.go`): an empty entity renders as
  `placeholderBody(title)`, and `isPlaceholderNoop` guards the reverse trip —
  a read-then-save of an empty document never pushes the fabricated heading to
  Linear as real content. Render and guard are defined together so they can't
  drift.
- **`FieldError`** lives here: a structured field/value/reason error the fs
  layer maps to errno + `.error` content (fs re-exports an alias).
- **ID resolution is deferred:** frontmatter holds human-friendly values
  (assignee *email*, label *names*, project *name*); marshal leaves them as-is
  and the fs layer resolves them to Linear IDs before calling the API. Helpers
  like `ScalarToString` / `StringSliceFromYAML` canonicalize YAML scalars.

**Consumed by** `internal/fs` only. Depends on `yaml.v3` and `api` types.

### `internal/fs` — the FUSE filesystem (the core, ~54 non-test files)

The serving end and the largest package, built on `go-fuse/v2`. The root struct
`LinearFS` (`linearfs.go`) is sectioned:

- **API seam:** the `api.Client` plus injectable interfaces —
  `MutationClient` (`mutationclient.go`, every mutation; swappable in tests via
  `testutil/mockmutation`), a `verifyReader` for read-your-writes refetches,
  and a catalog-refresher seam for the stale-catalog flow below.
- **Persistence:** `SQLiteRepository` (every metadata read, including
  `teams/{KEY}/docs/`, which is served from SQLite with a stale-while-revalidate
  background refresh like the project/initiative doc surfaces), `db.Store`, the
  `sync.Worker`, and the mount-lifetime `lifeCtx`/`spawn` pair that ties every
  background goroutine to unmount.
- **Sub-modules (embedded structs):** `writeFeedback` (the `.error` *and*
  `.last` state), `embeddedFileCache` (memory → disk → CDN bytes for embedded
  files), and `kernelNotify` (the only coupling to `*fuse.Server`).

Rather than one node type per path, most surfaces compose a small set of
building blocks:

- `renderFile` — any read-only generated file (`.meta` sidecars, `states.md`,
  `history.md`, the mount README). Serves with `FOPEN_DIRECT_IO`: generated
  content renders on every read and can never go stale behind the kernel page
  cache.
- `symlinkNode` — the one module behind every symlink view: `by/status|label|
  assignee`, `cycles/` (+ the `current` alias), `recent/`, `users/`, `my/`,
  `children/`, project issue symlinks, and initiative→project links. Target and
  times are fixed at construction (a Lookup answer and a later Getattr can never
  disagree); an unresolvable target is `ENOENT` at Lookup, never a dangling
  placeholder.
- `dirManifest` + `attrNode` — static directory children and attrs.
- The **listing family** — `namedListing`, `indexedListing`,
  `attachmentListing`, `relationListing`, `linkListing`: each directory's
  `Readdir` entries and `Lookup` are pure projections of one source, so any
  name you can `ls` you can also open and `rm`. The collision policies are
  deliberate and split: dedup (`foo (2).link`) is licensed only where the
  filename is *not* a resolution key (attachments, links); where it is (labels/
  milestones resolve by name, `.rel` names feed `rm`), collisions shadow
  first-match/emit-once — a suffixed name would resolve nowhere.
- `editBuffer` — the read/write buffer under every editable file, and
  `collectionTrio` + `createFileNode` — the writable-collection kit: the trio
  guarantees every writable directory serves `_create`/`.error`/`.last`
  uniformly, and `_create` uses a per-open file handle so each
  open-write-close cycle creates exactly one item.
- `ino(kind, id)` — one FNV-based inode namespace, stable across remounts.
- `nodeRefresher` — a re-looked-up node re-reads fresh entity data (go-fuse
  keeps the first node per inode), with a load-bearing conflict rule: **a dirty
  edit buffer always wins** — a user's in-flight edit is never clobbered by
  background sync, and Lookup reports the kept node's size so a fresh twin
  can't truncate kernel reads of longer dirty content.
- `resolveByName` — collapses the five regular single-name→ID resolvers
  (state, project, milestone, cycle, initiative); user, issue-identifier,
  label, and project-slug resolution remain bespoke.

**Read flow:** kernel → `Lookup`/`Readdir`/`Read` → Repository → SQLite →
marshal to markdown bytes. `mtime` = `updatedAt`, `ctime` = `createdAt`.

**Write flow (the important interaction).** Three sibling commit tails own the
write directions: `commitCreate` (`createcommit.go`), `commitWriteBack`
(`editcommit.go`), `commitDelete` (`deletecommit.go`). For an edit:
1. `Write` buffers bytes in the `editBuffer`; `Flush` parses the markdown via
   `marshal`. Editor save-via-rename (temp file + `rename`) is caught by a
   scratch node and routed through the same path (`atomicwrite.go`,
   `renamesave.go`).
2. The fs layer **resolves names to IDs** (status→stateId, assignee
   email→userId, labels→labelIds, project/milestone/cycle/parent→IDs). A local
   catalog miss self-heals: a typed unknown-name error triggers exactly **one**
   targeted catalog refresh — routed through the Sync Worker's
   `RefreshTeamCatalogs`/`RefreshWorkspaceCatalogs` so budget gates and prune
   licenses come free — then one retry before the write fails. This is the only
   place the write path drives the worker. Edits decompose into shared halves:
   `scalarEdit` (name/body), `labelsEdit`, `reconcileLinks` (initiative/project
   links).
3. On valid input, calls the `MutationClient`. `classifyMutationErr`
   (`createcommit.go`) is the single owner of the failure model: bad input →
   `EINVAL`, over-length field → `EMSGSIZE`, missing reference → `ENOENT`,
   rate-limit/timeout → `EAGAIN`, backend failure → `EIO` — reason always
   written to `.error`.
4. **Read-your-writes** (`editcommit.go`): re-derives what persisted — an
   independent refetch where a single-entity getter exists (issues, projects,
   initiatives), otherwise the mutation's echoed response — normalizes benign
   markdown reformatting, and flags a silent revert/truncation as `EIO`.
5. **Upserts the fresh result into SQLite** via the tail's per-spec persist
   closure (direct single-entity upserts; the `reconcile` tails belong to the
   worker and SWR, not this flow) and re-cohers the kernel through the
   intent-named `kernelNotify` policy methods — `InvalidateCreated` /
   `InvalidateUpdated` / `InvalidateDeleted` / `InvalidateRenamed`. Handlers
   never hand-pick the raw `InodeNotify`/`EntryNotify` primitives; hand-picked
   combinations drifted (missed dir inodes, un-notified unlinks) before the
   policy module existed.

**Delete flow:** `rm` of a comment/doc/label/relation/… or `rmdir`-archive of
an issue/project goes through `commitDelete`: API delete first, then a
**required** SQLite forget (retried on `SQLITE_BUSY` — the store is the listing
source of truth, so a skipped forget resurrects the item as a phantom), then
`InvalidateDeleted`. "Entity not found" on delete is idempotent success, so
re-`rm`ing a phantom row heals it.

**Special filesystem semantics:**
- **`_create` trigger files** (write-only, mode 0200): reads are rejected with
  `EACCES`; a write creates an item (issue, comment, doc, label, attachment,
  relation, update, …). Read-before-write editors can't use them — pipe content
  instead.
- **`.error` / `.last` sidecars** (read-only, backed by `writeFeedback`): every
  writable surface exposes the last failure's reason in `.error` (cleared on
  success) and, where the surface mints an entity, the created identity/URL in
  `.last` — so scripts and LLMs never have to parse an errno.
- **`.meta` sidecars:** editable files hold *only* editable fields; the
  server-managed fields (id, url, timestamps, …) render into a read-only
  `<name>.meta` twin. Editing a server field is impossible by construction.
- **Project labels** (`projectlabels.go`): `labels:` in `project.md` validates
  against the workspace-wide `project_labels` catalog (synced in the full
  cycle; browsable at the mount root as `project-labels.md`). Unknown IDs
  render verbatim and pass through the resolver, so a stale catalog can never
  strip labels on an untouched save; group/retired enforcement is deliberate
  policy that is *stricter* than the API (the server accepts retired-label
  assignment; LinearFS rejects it).
- **Generated README:** the mount root's `README.md` is generated at runtime by
  `generateReadme` (`root.go`) and is the primary doc agents read. Any change to
  a filesystem surface or contract must update it in the same change;
  `TestGeneratedReadmeMatchesBehavior` guards against drift.

**Consumed by** `internal/cmd` (which mounts it).

### `internal/telemetry` — OTEL metrics pipeline

Owns the meter provider the recording packages (api, sync, repo, reconcile)
record into; fs records no instruments — it only wires the per-request debug
log. One `MeterProvider`, two renderings: an always-on 5-minute summary line to
journald/logs, and a config-gated file export writing one compact JSON line per
interval to `~/.config/linearfs/metrics.jsonl` through a rotating writer
(diagnosis = `jq` over that file). There is no OTLP exporter. Exporter failure
degrades to summary-only — telemetry must never take the mount down.

### `internal/cmd` + `cmd/linearfs` + `internal/config` — wiring

`cmd/linearfs/main.go` calls `cmd.Execute()` (Cobra). Commands: `mount`
(with `--foreground`/`-f`, `--debug`/`-d`) and `version`. **Startup order**
(`mount.go` → `linearfs.go`):

1. `config.Load()` — reads `LINEAR_API_KEY` (env overrides file) and
   `~/.config/linearfs/config.yaml` (or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`); loading itself
   succeeds without a key.
2. `fs.PreflightMountpoint(...)` — detects and heals a wedged/stale FUSE mount
   at the target before mounting over it.
3. `telemetry.Init(...)` — metrics pipeline up before anything records.
4. `fs.NewLinearFS(cfg, debug)` — enforces the API key (errors if unset), then
   builds the `api.Client`; repo/store still nil.
5. `lfs.EnableSQLiteCache("")` — opens the cache DB (default via
   `db.DefaultDBPath()`: `os.UserConfigDir()/linearfs/cache.db` — deliberately
   *outside* the mountpoint), builds `SQLiteRepository`, loads the cached
   viewer into it, spawns a background viewer refresh, and starts the
   `sync.Worker` under `lifeCtx`.
6. `fs.MountFS(...)` — creates the root node, mounts via go-fuse (attr/entry
   timeouts 60s/30s), hands the server ref to `kernelNotify`.
7. On SIGINT/SIGTERM: unmount; after `server.Wait()` returns, flush telemetry
   *first* (the final export's observable gauges read the still-open store),
   then `lfs.Close()` — cancel `lifeCtx`, wait for spawned goroutines, stop the
   worker, close repo, store, and request log.

`internal/config` defines the config struct and load logic (including the
telemetry file/requests sections). `internal/testutil` provides test fixtures
and `mockmutation`, the in-memory fake behind the `MutationClient` seam.

## How the pieces fit together (interaction summary)

| Interaction | Direction | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| Sync Worker ← Linear | read | `api.Client` queries, lean/full cycles, incremental by `updatedAt` |
| Sync Worker → SQLite | write | `store.Queries().Upsert*` + `reconcile.Collection` tail (not via repo) |
| Sync Worker → kernel | *nothing* | deliberate: no invalidation from ingest; remote-change freshness is timeout-bounded (60s/30s) + `nodeRefresher` on re-Lookup |
| Repository ← SQLite | read | sqlc queries + hydrate-then-overlay converters → `api.*` types |
| Repository → Linear | background | SWR refreshes via `maybeRefreshSWR`, semaphore-bounded, never blocking; persists via `reconcile` |
| LinearFS ← Repository | read | ~48 concrete methods, every FUSE read |
| LinearFS ↔ marshal | both | `api.*` ↔ markdown; fs resolves names→IDs |
| LinearFS → Linear | write | `MutationClient` mutations on `Flush`/`_create`/`Mkdir`/`rm` (+ a few interactive-tier reads) |
| LinearFS → SQLite | write | commit tails upsert fresh results / forget deleted rows directly (`store.Queries()`) |
| LinearFS → Sync Worker | write path | one targeted catalog refresh on a local name miss, then one retry |
| LinearFS → kernel | invalidate | `kernelNotify` intent methods: `InvalidateCreated`/`Updated`/`Deleted`/`Renamed` |
| api/sync/repo/reconcile → telemetry | record | OTEL instruments → summary log + config-gated `metrics.jsonl` |
| cmd → everything | wiring | constructs and injects in startup order |

## Cross-cutting concerns

- **Caching is layered:** kernel page/attr cache → go-fuse node cache → SQLite.
  Writes must punch through the kernel layer explicitly (the `kernelNotify`
  intent methods), and re-looked-up nodes re-read entity data via the
  `nodeRefresher` seam — with the dirty-buffer-wins rule where user edits and
  background sync meet in one inode. Generated files opt out entirely: they
  render on every read (`FOPEN_DIRECT_IO`). The ingest side never invalidates;
  remote edits become visible when the 60s/30s kernel timeouts expire.
- **Rate budget is the scarce resource:** the client's dual-axis budget, the
  worker's lean cycles / cold-start probe / 80%-skip / 70%-defer thresholds /
  team rotation, and the tiered reserves all exist to keep the mount responsive
  within Linear's complexity budget. Writes always win; user-blocking reads
  jump the ladder via `WithInteractive`.
- **Staleness coordination:** `synced_at` + `detail_synced_at` columns, the SWR
  coordinator, the worker's incremental cursor + persisted `sync_schedule`
  watermarks, and catch-up mode all coordinate so the worker and on-demand
  refreshes don't duplicate work. Probes never prune, so deletions and
  link-changes are full-cycle-bounded.
- **Error surfacing contract:** every writable surface has a `.error` sibling
  (and `.last` where entities are minted). Bad input → `EINVAL`, over-length →
  `EMSGSIZE`, missing reference → `ENOENT`, rate-limited/timeout → `EAGAIN`,
  backend failure → `EIO`; the reason always lands in `.error`, cleared on
  success. A stale local catalog self-heals with one refresh-and-retry before
  any of that surfaces.
- **Time handling** is the most common footgun — both directions: parse reads
  via `ParseSQLiteTime*`, stamp writes via `db.Now()` (UTC). Inside the worker,
  scheduling goes through the injected clock seam.

## Observations worth a maintainer's attention

These surfaced while mapping the code and are noted as-is, not as prescriptions:

- **Embedded-file cache path is macOS-only.** `linearfs.go` hardcodes
  `~/Library/Caches/linearfs/files` even on Linux (where `~/.cache/linearfs`
  per XDG would be expected). Embedded-file downloads land there regardless of
  OS. (The SQLite cache DB itself is XDG-correct via `os.UserConfigDir()`.)
- **`--config` flag is inert.** `root.go` defines `--config`/`-c`, but
  `mount.go` calls `config.Load()` with no path, so the config location is
  effectively hardcoded to the XDG default.
- **Three `SyncedAt` stamps bypass `db.Now()`** and bind local-zone
  `time.Now()` values: the history cache (`repo/sqlite.go`, benign — never
  cutoff-pruned) and the attachment/relation write tails (`fs/attachments.go`,
  `fs/relations.go`), which *do* feed cutoff-compared prunes — latent
  misorder bugs east of UTC.
